# BPM Platform — Frontend Functional Requirements Specification

**Version:** 0.1-draft · 2026-05-20  
**Backend reference:** BPM_Platform_Functional_Requirements.md v0.2-draft  
**Technology stack:** React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5, Vite, React Router v7
(React version corrected 2026-08-22 under `REQ-119` to match the version
actually locked in `web/package-lock.json`; this document originally said
"React 19", carried over from R-Co)

---

## Introduction

This document specifies functional requirements for the BPM Platform web frontend — a single-page application that consumes the platform's REST API and provides role-appropriate interfaces for all four actor types: **PLATFORM_ADMIN**, **PROCESS_DESIGNER**, **PROCESS_OPERATOR**, and **TASK_WORKER**.

The frontend has no business logic of its own. All data mutations go through the platform REST API. The UI reflects the current state of the backend and provides tools to navigate it effectively.

**Priority notation:**

- **MUST** — mandatory for the area to be usable; no release without it.
- **SHOULD** — strongly recommended; defer only with documented reason.
- **COULD** — desirable if capacity allows.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Workspace** | The authenticated user's top-level application shell, rendered after login |
| **Process Designer view** | The visual canvas for creating and editing process definition graphs |
| **Task Inbox** | A TASK_WORKER's personal queue of assigned and claimable tasks |
| **Instance Board** | An OPERATOR's view of all running, completed, and errored instances |
| **Control Panel** | PLATFORM_ADMIN views for users, groups, tokens, and system health |
| **Canvas** | The drag-and-drop area inside the Process Designer view |

## Non-Functional Requirements (Frontend)

| ID | Requirement | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **FNFR-01** | **Initial load (LCP)** | Largest Contentful Paint ≤ 2.5 s on a 4G connection (Lighthouse score ≥ 90) |
| **FNFR-02** | **Interaction responsiveness** | UI interactions (navigation, filter changes) SHALL produce visible feedback within 100 ms |
| **FNFR-03** | **Accessibility** | All interactive elements SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard navigation MUST be fully supported |
| **FNFR-04** | **Browser support** | Latest two stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge |
| **FNFR-05** | **Error resilience** | A failed API call SHALL never leave the UI in a broken or blank state; a recoverable error message with a retry action MUST be shown |
| **FNFR-06** | **Token storage** | The API token SHALL be stored in an `httpOnly` session cookie or memory only — never in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` |
| **FNFR-07** | **Responsive layout** | All views SHALL be usable on viewports ≥ 1024 px wide; the Task Inbox SHALL additionally be usable on viewports ≥ 375 px (mobile) |

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

- The frontend communicates exclusively with the BPM Platform REST API — no direct database access, no other backends.
- Authentication is Bearer token–based (API-08). The frontend exchanges credentials (or a bootstrap token in development) for an API token via a login flow.
- The frontend is a static SPA deployed to a CDN or served by a simple file server; it has no server-side rendering requirement.
- Real-time updates (e.g. task inbox refresh) are achieved via polling unless the platform adds WebSocket/SSE support in a future stage.
- The visual process graph renderer/editor uses [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) as the canvas library.
- All date/times are displayed in the user's browser locale and timezone; stored/transmitted values are UTC ISO 8601.

## Locale policy (`REQ-127`/`REQ-285`, 2026-08-22/2026-09-09)

### REQ-127's original finding (2026-08-22, kept intact as a dated historical record)

**Finding: there is no locale policy today.** `web/` is effectively English-only
with unmediated browser-locale date formatting. This was verified by reading
`web/src/` directly (not inferred from this document, which is the thing that
was under-specified), and by `web/package.json` — the finding below, established
2026-08-22.

- **No i18n library.** `web/package.json` declares no `react-intl`, `i18next`,
  `formatjs`, or equivalent, in either `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.
  `grep -rln "react-intl\|i18next\|formatjs" web/src/` returns nothing.
- **No supported locale set, no fallback chain.** Nothing in `web/src/` reads
  `navigator.language` or `navigator.languages`, and nothing constructs an
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat` or `Intl.NumberFormat` with an explicit locale list.
  There is no concept of "supported locales" for the session to fall back
  through — the runtime's default locale (whatever the browser/OS is set to)
  is used implicitly wherever a locale-sensitive call is made.
- **25 date/time formatting call sites, all bare `.toLocale*()` calls, one
  inconsistent.** `grep -rn "toLocaleDateString\|toLocaleTimeString\|toLocaleString" web/src/`
  finds 25 call sites (27 grep-matched lines; `web/src/pages/tasks/TaskInboxPage.tsx:213`
  makes two calls on one line) across 20 files:
  `src/components/definitions/DraftBanner.tsx:46`,
  `src/components/instances/EventHistoryPanel.tsx:202`,
  `src/components/instances/TimelineFeedItem.tsx:18`,
  `src/components/promotions/PromotionReviewStateMachine.tsx:62`,
  `src/components/webhooks/WebhookDeliveryAttemptsTable.tsx:11`,
  `src/components/webhooks/WebhookSubscriptionDetailPanel.tsx:31`,
  `src/pages/admin/AuditLogPage.tsx:174`,
  `src/pages/admin/HealthDashboardPage.tsx:37,68`,
  `src/pages/admin/modules/ProcessModulesPage.tsx:100,102,139`,
  `src/pages/admin/tenants/TenantsPage.tsx:212`,
  `src/pages/admin/TokensPage.tsx:37`,
  `src/pages/admin/users/UsersPage.tsx:142`,
  `src/pages/admin/UsersPage.tsx:352`,
  `src/pages/definitions/DefinitionListPage.tsx:276,313`,
  `src/pages/dlq/DlqPage.tsx:111`,
  `src/pages/dlq/WebhooksPage.tsx:285`,
  `src/pages/instances/InstanceBoardPage.tsx:26,31`,
  `src/pages/instances/InstanceDetailPage.tsx:35,40`,
  `src/pages/instances/timelineUtils.ts:55`,
  `src/pages/tasks/TaskInboxPage.tsx:213,338`.
  24 of the 25 calls pass no locale argument (`.toLocaleString()`,
  `.toLocaleDateString()`, `.toLocaleTimeString()`), so they resolve to
  whatever locale the JS runtime's default is (in a browser, the OS/browser
  language setting) — this is what "displayed in the user's browser locale"
  in the constraint above actually means in code: an emergent property of
  calling the unparameterised `Intl` default, not a configured policy. One
  call, `src/pages/admin/UsersPage.tsx:352`, hardcodes
  `.toLocaleDateString('en-US')` — the one place in the codebase where a
  locale literal appears — which makes that one row format as US-style
  regardless of the viewer's own browser locale, inconsistent with every
  other date in the app.
- **No tenant-authored `{locale: value}` content map exists.** `web/src/types/`
  contains exactly `api.ts` and `forms.ts`. Neither declares a locale-keyed
  map; the closest shapes are generic `Record<string, unknown>` fields (JSON
  payloads, schemas, variables) with no locale semantics. `grep -rn -i
  "locale\|translat\|i18n" web/src/types/` returns nothing. There is no
  tenant content anywhere in `web/src/` that resolves against a session
  locale — session locale itself isn't a concept the app has.
- **User-visible strings are hardcoded English JSX text, not resource-backed.**
  A grep for JSX text nodes matching `>[A-Za-z...]<` across `web/src/**/*.tsx`
  (`grep -rEn ">[A-Z][a-zA-Z ,.'!?-]{3,}<" web/src --include="*.tsx" | wc -l`)
  counts 315 matches across the 86 `.tsx` files under `web/src/`. This is a
  lower bound (it only catches text directly between tags, not JSX
  expressions or attribute strings) but establishes the order of magnitude.

**What adopting a real policy would require, concretely:**

1. **A locale library.** None is installed; `react-intl` or `i18next` (with
   `react-i18next`) would need to be added to `web/package.json` — a new
   runtime dependency, not currently forbidden by anything in
   `docs/agents/instructions/` but outside FRONTEND-DEV's existing toolset
   (React Router / TanStack Query / Zustand) and therefore a decision for
   REVIEWER, not a FRONTEND-DEV unilateral pick.
2. **Externalizing ~315 hardcoded strings** (the grep count above) out of
   JSX into resource files, plus wiring every component that renders them
   through the chosen library's translation hook/component.
3. **Replacing the 25 bare `.toLocale*()` call sites** listed above with
   locale-aware formatting driven by a session locale (e.g.
   `Intl.DateTimeFormat(sessionLocale, opts)` or the i18n library's date
   formatter), including fixing the one hardcoded `'en-US'` outlier so it's
   no longer the sole inconsistent case.
4. **A session-locale concept** — where it comes from (`Accept-Language`,
   a user preference, a query param), how it's stored, and a fallback chain
   when the requested locale isn't supported — none of which exists today
   and all of which would need a design decision, not just code.
5. **A tenant-content locale map**, if/when tenant-authored localized
   content (the shape `MOB-7` in `docs/mobile/requirements.md` refers to)
   is introduced — no such shape exists in `web/src/types/` today, so this
   is new modeling work, not a resolution of an existing gap.

None of the above has been started as of 2026-08-22. This subsection records the
finding, not a commitment to do the work — see `docs/requirements.yaml`'s `REQ-127`
for the investigation that produced it. **REQ-285 (below) adopted the work this
subsection scoped.**

### What REQ-285 adopted (2026-09-09)

**This adoption ships an English-only string catalogue by design. Locale-aware
date/time formatting and a real fallback chain are live as of REQ-285; translating
the application's UI strings into any language other than English is explicitly out
of REQ-285's scope and is a separate, later requirement. An English-only catalogue
at this point is the intended state, not an unfinished implementation.**

REQ-285 re-ran REQ-127's greps at its own start (2026-09-09) rather than inheriting
the 2026-08-22 counts, and found they had drifted: **25 grep-matched lines / 26
actual `.toLocale*()` invocations across 19 files** (down from 25 call sites / 27
grep-matched lines / 20 files — two `UsersPage.tsx` files from 2026-08-22 had since
been consolidated into one). All 26 invocations were converted to locale-aware
formatting; none remain bare. The one hardcoded-locale call,
`src/pages/admin/UsersPage.tsx` (`.toLocaleDateString('en-US')`), no longer
hardcodes a locale.

- **Library: `react-intl`.** Chosen over `i18next`/`react-i18next` — see
  `docs/migration/decisions/0021-web-i18n-library.md` for the full rationale.
  Decisive factor: most of the 26 call sites are plain module-scope helper
  functions, not JSX-inline expressions, and react-intl's imperative
  `createIntl()`/`IntlShape` API reaches them without restructuring their call
  signatures, unlike a hook-only API. Added to `web/package.json` as a runtime
  dependency (not a devDependency).
- **Supported locale set — `PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_LOCALES`** (`web/src/i18n/sessionLocale.ts`):
  a finite, curated set of 10 BCP-47 tags governing date/time formatting locale only
  (decoupled from UI string translation, which stays English-only per above):
  `en`, `en-US`, `en-GB`, `es`, `es-ES`, `fr`, `fr-FR`, `de`, `de-DE`, `pt-BR`.
- **Fallback chain — precedence order**, implemented by `resolveSessionLocale`:
  1. **Tenant `default_locale`** (when supplied) — wins if it is a member of
     `PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_LOCALES`. A tenant's own configured default is the most
     specific signal available and should win over an individual visitor's browser
     setting when both are known.
  2. **Browser preference** (`navigator.languages`, or `navigator.language` if
     unavailable) — the first entry, in the browser's own preference order, that is
     a member of `PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_LOCALES`.
  3. **`FALLBACK_LOCALE`** (`"en"`, deliberately not `"en-US"` — that literal was
     the defect this adoption removed) — used when neither of the above yields a
     member.
- **The tenant-default-supply gap (open, stated explicitly, not silently
  resolved).** There is currently no path by which the web SPA can learn a
  tenant's `default_locale`: `GET /api/tenant-config` (REQ-281) deliberately
  excludes locale data per its own moduledoc's security constraint; only
  `GET /api/mobile/tenant-config` (REQ-282) serves it, to the mobile tier only,
  which the web SPA never calls. `resolveSessionLocale`/`setTenantDefaultLocale`
  are built and fully tested today using an injected test double for the tenant
  default, but no production call site supplies a real value —
  `useSessionLocaleStore` bootstraps with `tenantDefaultLocale: null`, so tier 1 of
  the chain never fires in production today; the app runs on tiers 2–3 until a
  future requirement extends `GET /api/tenant-config` with a locale field (a
  security-relevant response-shaping change, same class as REQ-281 itself) and
  wires the call.

## Stage F1 — Application Shell & Authentication

**Goal:** A running web application with login, role-aware navigation, and an empty workspace per role. The foundation all other views build on.

| ID | Requirement | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SH-01** | **Login screen** *(superseded — see [decision 0035](migration/decisions/0035-frontend-login-delegated-to-keycloak.md); login is fully delegated to Keycloak's hosted UI, no in-app token-input screen exists or is planned)* | The application SHALL present a login screen with a token input field when no valid session exists. On submit, the token is validated against `GET /health/ready` (using the token). On success, the user's role set is decoded from the token context and the workspace is rendered. On failure, a clear error message is shown. | ~~MUST~~ |
| **SH-02** | **Session persistence** | The authenticated session SHALL persist across page reloads (stored in `httpOnly` cookie or in-memory with a silent re-auth flow). Expired or revoked tokens SHALL trigger an automatic redirect to the login screen with a session-expired message. | **MUST** |
| **SH-03** | **Role-aware navigation** | The global sidebar/navbar SHALL display only the navigation items the current user's role set permits. Items for areas outside the user's permissions SHALL be hidden entirely, not greyed out. | **MUST** |
| **SH-04** | **Active user indicator** | The shell SHALL display the current user's `display_name` and roles in the header. A logout action SHALL clear the session and return to the login screen. | **MUST** |
| **SH-05** | **Global error boundary** | An unhandled runtime error in any view SHALL be caught and render a recoverable error panel with a "reload this view" action, without crashing the entire application. | **MUST** |
| **SH-06** | **API connectivity banner** | If `GET /health/ready` returns non-200, the shell SHALL display a non-blocking banner: "Platform is currently unavailable — some actions may fail." The banner auto-dismisses when health recovers. | **SHOULD** |
| **SH-07** | **Keyboard shortcut map** | A discoverable keyboard shortcut (e.g. `?`) SHALL open an overlay listing all available keyboard shortcuts. | **COULD** |

---

## Stage F1.5 — OIDC SSO Login

**Goal:** Users can log in via Keycloak OIDC authorization code flow. *(Historical goal
text, superseded by [decision 0035](migration/decisions/0035-frontend-login-delegated-to-keycloak.md):
the shipped architecture is Keycloak-hosted-redirect-only — there is no in-app login
screen and no token-paste field to preserve.)* ~~from the existing login screen without
copy-pasting tokens. The developer token paste field is preserved unchanged.~~

| ID | Requirement | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OIDC-F-01** | **SSO login button** *(superseded — see [decision 0035](migration/decisions/0035-frontend-login-delegated-to-keycloak.md); the SPA redirects straight to Keycloak's hosted UI via `ProtectedRoute.tsx`, there is no in-app login screen for a button to sit "alongside")* | The login screen SHALL display a "Sign in with Keycloak" button alongside the existing token input. Clicking it initiates the OIDC authorization code flow using `oidc-client-ts`. The provider URL is read from `VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY` (default: `http://localhost:8082/realms/bpm-default` — Letflow's own Keycloak port, set by REQ-128; the earlier `8081` default was R-Co's nginx gateway port and does not apply here) and the client ID from `VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` (default: `letflow-web`, renamed from R-Co's `bpm-platform-api` by REQ-133 — see `priv/keycloak/realms/bpm-default.json`'s `clientId`). | ~~MUST~~ |
| **OIDC-F-02** | **OIDC callback handler** | The application SHALL include a `/auth/callback` route that receives the Keycloak redirect, exchanges the authorization code for tokens using `oidc-client-ts`, stores the access token in memory via the existing `setToken()` API, decodes the display name from the JWT (roles and permissions come from `GET /api/v1/me/access`, never from token claims; REQ-450), and redirects the user to the application workspace. Errors in the callback (invalid state, expired code) SHALL redirect to the login page with `?reason=auth-error`. `oidc-client-ts` MUST be initialised with `userStore: new InMemoryWebStorage()` so that its own internal state (ID token, refresh token, PKCE verifier) is also kept in memory only — never in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` (FNFR-06). | **MUST** |
| **OIDC-F-03** | **Silent token renewal** | If the OIDC provider supports silent renew (`prompt=none` in a hidden iframe), the application SHOULD attempt to renew the access token before it expires, keeping the session alive without user interaction. If silent renew fails, the standard session-expired flow (SH-02) applies. | **SHOULD** |
| **OIDC-F-04** | **OIDC logout** | The logout action (SH-04) SHALL, when the session was established via OIDC, additionally call the Keycloak end-session endpoint to invalidate the SSO session. Internal token sessions (non-OIDC) use the existing logout path unchanged. | **SHOULD** |

---

## Stage F1.6 — Subdomain Tenant Routing

**Goal:** The frontend and backend cooperate to route users to the correct Keycloak realm based on the subdomain (hostname) they use to access the platform. This enables multi-tenant deployments where each tenant has its own subdomain and OIDC realm without requiring per-tenant frontend builds.

| ID | Feature | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OIDC-F-05** | **Tenant-config discovery endpoint** | A public backend endpoint `GET /api/tenant-config?host={hostname}` returns the OIDC authority URL and client ID for the tenant bound to the given hostname. If no binding is found, the default tenant config is returned. | **MUST** |
| **OIDC-F-06** | **Dynamic OIDC config from hostname** | On app startup, the frontend reads `window.location.hostname`, calls `GET /api/tenant-config?host={hostname}`, and uses the returned `oidc_authority` and `client_id` to initialize `OidcManager` instead of the static env var values. Env vars remain as compile-time fallbacks. | **MUST** |

### OIDC-F-05 — Tenant-config discovery endpoint `[MUST]`

> The backend MUST expose a public endpoint `GET /api/tenant-config?host={hostname}` that returns `{ "oidc_authority": string, "client_id": string }` for the tenant whose registered hostname matches the `host` query parameter. The `oidc_authority` is derived from the tenant's Keycloak realm binding (per OIDC-12). If no tenant is bound to the given hostname, the endpoint MUST return the default tenant config (`bpm-default` realm). The endpoint requires no authentication and its response is cacheable (no sensitive data). This requires a `hostname` column or join table linking a tenant to its registered hostname(s).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `GET /api/tenant-config?host=acme1.localhost` returns `{ "oidc_authority": "http://localhost:8082/realms/bpm-acme1", "client_id": "letflow-web" }` when `acme1.localhost` is bound to the acme1 tenant (host port and client ID per OIDC-F-01's Letflow defaults).
- `GET /api/tenant-config?host=unknown.localhost` returns the default tenant config with HTTP 200 (not 404).
- Endpoint requires no JWT or session cookie to respond.
- Response body is valid JSON with both `oidc_authority` and `client_id` fields present.

**See:** OIDC-12 (realm-tenant binding provides the authority URL), ADP-03 (tenant context), OIDC-F-06 (frontend consumes this endpoint)

---

### OIDC-F-06 — Dynamic OIDC config from hostname `[MUST]`

> On app startup, before rendering `LoginPage`, the frontend MUST read `window.location.hostname`, call `GET /api/tenant-config?host={hostname}`, and use the returned `oidc_authority` and `client_id` to initialize `OidcManager` instead of the static `VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY` / `VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` env var values. The call MUST be made exactly once per session and the result MUST be cached (module-level singleton or Zustand store). `VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY` and `VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` remain as compile-time fallbacks used if the API call fails or returns no usable value. If the `/api/tenant-config` call fails (network error or non-200 response), the app MUST fall back to the env var values silently — login MUST still be possible. A loading spinner is acceptable while the config fetch is in flight; a blank screen is not.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When the app is accessed via `acme1.localhost`, clicking the SSO button initiates OIDC flow against `http://localhost:8081/realms/bpm-acme1`.
- When the app is accessed via `localhost`, the SSO button uses the default realm (`bpm-default`).
- If `/api/tenant-config` returns HTTP 500, the app falls back to env var values and the login page renders normally without error.
- The tenant-config fetch is not repeated on subsequent renders or route changes within the same session.

**See:** OIDC-F-01 (SSO login button and OidcManager initialization), OIDC-F-05 (discovery endpoint this requirement consumes)

---

## Stage F1.7 — Tenant Dashboard & Workspace Identity

**Goal:** Tenant administrators see a branded, scoped workspace immediately after login via their company's Keycloak realm. Every authenticated page confirms which company workspace the user is in, and the platform routes them to the correct tenant context automatically without requiring a manual selection step.

<!-- Origin: UAT run WF05-swiftroute-onboarding-gui-20260616, ISSUE-EO004 — tenant admin Alice Bauer sees a generic BPM UI with no company context after completing tenant onboarding. -->

| ID | Requirement | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TD-UI-01** | **Tenant-scoped landing page** | After login via a tenant Keycloak realm, the authenticated user SHALL be redirected to a dashboard page that prominently displays the tenant's `display_name` (e.g. "SwiftRoute Ltd") as the page heading. All data tiles on the dashboard (recent process definitions, active instances, pending tasks) SHALL be scoped to the authenticated user's tenant. No data from other tenants SHALL be visible on this page. | **MUST** |
| **TD-UI-02** | **Tenant identity indicator** | Every authenticated page in the application SHALL display the tenant's `display_name` in the global navigation bar or header area, alongside the user's own `display_name` (SH-04). The tenant name SHALL be hidden on the login screen (unauthenticated state) and SHALL be cleared from the header immediately upon logout. | **MUST** |
| **TD-UI-03** | **Tenant realm routing** | The frontend SHOULD detect the Keycloak realm from the authenticated access token's `iss` (issuer) claim after OIDC login and route the user to the correct tenant context automatically. No manual tenant selection step or "choose your organisation" prompt SHOULD be presented to users who authenticate via a known tenant realm. | **SHOULD** |

### TD-UI-01 — Tenant-scoped landing page `[MUST]`

> After completing OIDC login via a tenant realm (e.g. `bpm-swiftroute`), the frontend MUST redirect the authenticated user to a tenant dashboard page. This page MUST display the tenant's `display_name` as a visible heading or hero element (readable in a Playwright screenshot without additional interaction). All data presented on this page — recent process definitions, active instances, pending tasks — MUST be fetched using the authenticated user's token, which is scoped to their tenant, so only that tenant's data is returned. The page MUST NOT render any cross-tenant data, admin-only data, or platform-level global views unless the user also holds PLATFORM_ADMIN role.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A Playwright screenshot taken immediately after OIDC login via a tenant realm shows the tenant `display_name` (e.g. "SwiftRoute Ltd") as a heading on the landing page.
- The tenant dashboard is the first route rendered after the OIDC callback redirect completes (OIDC-F-02).
- Data tiles on the dashboard return only tenant-scoped results (verified by the absence of data from a second, independently created tenant).
- The page loads and displays the tenant name within 2.5 s (per FNFR-01).

**See:** OIDC-F-02 (OIDC callback redirect), OIDC-F-06 (dynamic realm detection), TD-UI-02 (identity indicator on every page), TD-UI-03 (automatic routing to tenant context)

---

### TD-UI-02 — Tenant identity indicator `[MUST]`

> The authenticated application shell MUST display the tenant's `display_name` in the global navigation bar or header, visible on every route that requires authentication. The tenant name MUST appear alongside the user's own `display_name` (per SH-04). It MUST NOT be shown on the login screen, the `/auth/callback` route, or any other unauthenticated route. On logout (SH-04), the tenant name MUST be cleared from the header and MUST NOT persist after the session is destroyed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A Playwright screenshot taken from any authenticated route (tenant dashboard, instance board, task inbox, definitions list) shows the tenant `display_name` in the nav/header region.
- A Playwright screenshot taken on the login page does NOT show any tenant name.
- After logout, the login screen screenshot does NOT show the tenant name.
- The tenant name is rendered as accessible text (readable by screen reader, WCAG 2.1 AA per FNFR-03), not embedded only in an image or icon.

**See:** SH-03 (role-aware navigation shell), SH-04 (active user indicator), TD-UI-01 (tenant-scoped landing page), OIDC-F-04 (OIDC logout clears session)

---

### TD-UI-03 — Tenant realm routing `[SHOULD]`

> After a successful OIDC login, the frontend SHOULD parse the `iss` claim of the access token to determine which Keycloak realm the session originated from. This realm maps to a specific tenant (per OIDC-12 and OIDC-F-05). The frontend SHOULD use this mapping to initialise the tenant context (populate the tenant `display_name` per TD-UI-02 and route to the correct tenant dashboard per TD-UI-01) without requiring the user to perform any additional selection step. If realm-to-tenant mapping cannot be resolved (e.g. unknown realm), the user SHOULD be shown an informative error message and redirected to the login screen — not left on a generic or broken page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- After OIDC login via `http://localhost:8081/realms/bpm-swiftroute`, a Playwright screenshot immediately after the callback shows the SwiftRoute tenant dashboard, with no "select tenant" or "choose organisation" prompt visible at any point.
- If the token `iss` claim refers to an unrecognised realm, the user is redirected to the login page with a clear error message (not a blank screen or unhandled exception).
- A Playwright screenshot taken on the first authenticated route after OIDC callback completion shows the correct tenant display_name — no untitled or generic placeholder text is present.

**See:** OIDC-12 (realm-tenant binding), OIDC-F-05 (tenant-config discovery endpoint), OIDC-F-06 (dynamic OIDC config from hostname), TD-UI-01 (tenant-scoped landing page), TD-UI-02 (tenant identity indicator)

---

## Stage F2 — Process Definition Management

**Goal:** PROCESS_DESIGNER and PLATFORM_ADMIN users can create, version, and manage process definitions through both a list view and a visual canvas editor.

### F2-A: Definition List View

| ID | Requirement | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PD-UI-01** | **Definition list** | The definitions view SHALL display a paginated, searchable table of all process definitions showing: name, latest version, status badge (DRAFT / ACTIVE / DEPRECATED / ARCHIVED), and creation date. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-02** | **Status filter** | The list SHALL support filtering by status (multi-select). The active filter SHALL be reflected in the URL query string and survive page reload. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-03** | **Version history** | Clicking a definition name SHALL expand an inline version history row showing all versions for that name, each with its status and a link to open that version. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-04** | **Create definition** | A "New Definition" button SHALL open a form modal for entering name, version string, and description. On submit, it calls `POST /definitions` and navigates to the Process Designer canvas for the new DRAFT. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-05** | **Lifecycle actions** | Each definition row SHALL surface contextual actions based on current status: DRAFT → [Edit, Activate, Delete]; ACTIVE → [View, Deprecate]; DEPRECATED → [View, Archive]; ARCHIVED → [View]. Actions unavailable for the current user's role SHALL be hidden. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-06** | **Activate confirmation** | Activating a definition that would deprecate an existing ACTIVE version SHALL show a confirmation dialog listing the version being deprecated before proceeding. | **MUST** |

| **PD-UI-11** | **Edge creation** | The user SHALL connect two nodes by dragging from a source handle to a target handle. Edges from EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY nodes SHALL prompt for a CEL condition expression or a "default edge" toggle on creation. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-12** | **Node properties panel** | Clicking a node SHALL open an inline properties panel where the user can set all required and optional attributes for that node type (e.g. `assignee_type`, `assignee_ref`, `form_schema`, `escalation_timer_duration` for HUMAN_TASK). | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-13** | **Inline validation feedback** | The canvas SHALL run client-side graph validation (mirroring PD-02 rules) continuously and display inline error indicators on offending nodes/edges (e.g. a red border on an isolated node). A validation summary panel SHALL list all errors before save is allowed. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-14** | **Save** | A Save button SHALL call `PUT /definitions/:id` (full graph replacement for DRAFTs) and display a success toast or inline error. Unsaved changes SHALL be tracked; navigating away with unsaved changes triggers a confirmation dialog. | **MUST** |
| **PD-UI-15** | **Read-only mode** | Definitions with status ACTIVE, DEPRECATED, or ARCHIVED SHALL open in read-only mode. The canvas is non-interactive; node/edge details are still viewable. A banner communicates the read-only state. | **MUST** |

| **TK-UI-03** | **Dynamic form rendering** | If the task node defines a `form_schema` (JSON Schema), the task detail panel SHALL render a dynamic form with appropriate field types (text, number, boolean, date, select, etc.). Required fields are enforced client-side before submission. | **MUST** |
| **TK-UI-04** | **Complete task** | A "Complete" button SHALL collect the form field values as the output variables map and call `POST /tasks/:id/complete`. On success, the task is removed from the inbox and a success toast is shown. On server-side error (e.g. variable schema violation), the error is shown inline. | **MUST** |
| **TK-UI-05** | **Claim task** | For tasks assigned to a group or role (not yet personally assigned), a "Claim" button SHALL call `POST /tasks/:id/assign` with the current user's ID. Claimed tasks appear in "My Tasks". | **MUST** |
